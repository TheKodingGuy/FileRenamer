# File_Renamer
A script for renaming individual files in a given directory.

## How to use this script

First, copy the path of the directory where the files you want to rename are stored.

Second, add the path to the "rename" variable in the file "file_renamer_v01.py".

Third, run the script.

Hope this works :D
